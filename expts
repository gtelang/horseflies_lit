- Greedy incremental, post optimizer LP/SLSQP.
     I am not aplying this inside the body of the function. 
     Igt should be applied just after the *.........while loop......*
- Collinear horseflies tour length / That obtained after post optimizer
- Greedy incremental with post=optimizer/TSP with post-optimizer
- Greedy incremental vs/ wweight of phi mst, is it good? 
  An example where the algorithm greedy gives better example than phi-=mst


All these, do not add to interactive right now except for first.
