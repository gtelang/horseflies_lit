Things to do , rotating list
----------------------------

- [ ] The degree bug in the split-partition heuristic
- [ ] The SOCP for multiple drones
- [ ] Doubling a given tree
- [ ] Recursive TSP maxdisp base-module
- [ ] Sujoy heurisitc, based on matching
- [ ] Package Handoff, Voronoi diagram generator, based on sequence
- [ ] Description of the 3-approx algorithm for single package handoff
- [ ] Description of the 3-approx algorithm for a simple generalization of the Voronoi diagram, you've described
- [ ] Proof of monotonicity of the optimal Package Handoff curve, write down in full
- [ ] Split partition, how does it perform when generating the TSP order
- [ ] The Convex Hull algorithm data-parallel version
- [ ] Reverse Hosefly fix the program
- [ ] Generate good data-sets, of various types according to 
      various parameters, use Bentley style data-sets. 
- [ ] Can we extract the lower-bound for TSP? 
- [ ] Nearest Neighborhood graphs intersection with the TSP. How many data-sets 
      from TSP lib have this property? Does you conjecture of where the edge lies 
      i.e. on the convex hull true? This can be very useful in pinning down the 
      exact structure. 
- [ ] Multiple Package Handoff, can you fix the wavelet code which works for many wavelets? 

Use scratch paper to make quick sketches and a rough working pad. I should be done with 
all these by the end of next week. Complete this by November 27th. The rest of it you should
dedicate to adding Teichmuller and r-gather, and then keep polishing till December 4th, the 
day you will submit the first version of the thesis, and then work on slides in the morning
then thesis and then the slides again, finish everything by the 14th, and then review and 
redo.
