\section{Module Overview}

\newchunk 
All algorithms to solve the reverse horsefly problems have been implemented in 
\verb|problem_reverse_horsefly.py|. The \verb|run_handler| function acts 
as a kind of main function for this module. It is called from 
\verb|main.py| to process the command-line arguments and run the 
experimental or interactive sections of the code.
