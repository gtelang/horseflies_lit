\chapter{One Horse, Multiple Flies}
\label{chap:one-horse-multiple-flies}

\section{Module Overview}
If one fly wasn't exciting enough for you, how about multiple flies?! The added complexity
in the problem comes from finding which sites need to be serviced by each of the flies 
\textit{and} the order in which these sites need to be serviced. To play around with the 
algorithms in interactive mode, run \texttt{main.py} as 

\begin{center}
\texttt{python main.py --problem-one-horse-multiple-flies}. 
\end{center}

The structure of this chapter is similar to \autoref{chap:classic-horsefly}. In fact, 
we will be using some of the algorithms from that chapter as black-box routines in 
the algorithms to be described here. 


All algorithms to solve the multiple flies 
\footnote{For the rest of this chapter we will refer to the one horse, 
multiple flies problem simply as the multiple flies problem.} 
problem have been implemented in \texttt{problem\_one\_horse\_multiple\_flies.py}. 
As bfore, the \verb|run_handler| function acts as a kind of main function for this module. 
It is called from \verb|main.py| to process the command-line arguments and run the 
experimental or interactive sections of the code.

\vspace{-0.8cm}\newchunk The logger variable becomes becomes global in scope to this module. This allows
me to write customized \texttt{debug} and \texttt{info} functions that let's me format 
the log messages according to the frame level. I learned this trick from the following 
Stack Overflow post \url{https://stackoverflow.com/a/5500099/505306}.

\vspace{-0.8cm}\newchunk The key-press handler function detects the keys pressed by the user when the canvas
is in active focus. This function allows you to set some of the input parameters like 
speed ratio $\varphi$, or selecting an algorithm interactively at the command-line, 
generating a bunch of uniform or non-uniformly distributed points on the canvas, 
or just plain clearing the canvas for inserting a fresh input set of points. 

%{python-mode}%
@d Define key-press handler
@{   
# The key-stack argument is mutable! I am using this hack to my advantage.
def wrapperkeyPressHandler(fig,ax, run): 
       def _keyPressHandler(event):
           if event.key in ['i', 'I']:  
                @< Start entering input from the command-line @>
           elif event.key in ['n', 'N', 'u', 'U']: 
                @< Generate a bunch of uniform or non-uniform random points on the canvas @>
           elif event.key in ['c', 'C']: 
                @< Clear canvas and states of all objects @>
       return _keyPressHandler
@| wrapperkeyPressHandler @}
%{/python-mode}%



\vspace{-0.8cm}\newchunk Before running an algorithm, the user needs to select through 
a menu displayed at the terminal, which one to run. Each algorithm itself, may be 
run under different conditions, so depending on the key-pressed(and thus algorithm chosen) 
further sub-menus will be generated at the command-line. 

After running the appropriate algorithm, we render the structure computed to a matplotlib canvas/window
along with possibly some meta data about the run at the terminal. 

%{python-mode}%

\vspace{-0.8cm} \newchunk We assume that all flies have the same velocity
%{python-mode}%
@d Set speed and number of flies 
@{
phi_str = raw_input(Fore.YELLOW + "What should I set the speed of each of the flies to be (should be >1)? : " + Style.RESET_ALL)
nof_str = raw_input(Fore.YELLOW + "How many flies do you want me to assign to the horse? : " + Style.RESET_ALL)

phi = float(phi_str)
nof = int(nof_str)
@| @}
%{/python-mode}%



\vspace{-0.8cm} \newchunk Each of the algorithms can have several tuning strategies. 
Depending on the algorithm selected, further sub-menus will have to be generated for 
selecting these sub-strategies. It is best, if all these strategies, are all set 
through a configuration file, like say YAML, rather than have to generate the menus. 

What configurations are valid or not will have to be set later. However, for now, I 
will only implement a simple menu ala classic horsefly to get something working. 
For now, I am implementing the super-drone heuristic with the greedy-incremental 
strategy for the super-drone. For the super-drone category, we will also have 
to specify a partitioning scheme of which sites get assigned to which drones. 

Also the post-optimizer for the super-drone will have to be specified. Too....many....flags! 
Needs a careful documenting in terms of tables of what is allowed and what is not allowed
that is available for ready-reference for the user, and hopefully one that is updated
automatically when the combination is made. Maybe this can be useful for the defense.  

For now, we just stick to super-drones

\vspace{-0.8cm}\newchunk This chunk generates points uniformly or non-uniformly distributed in the 
unit square $[0,1]^2$ in the Matplotlib canvas. I will document the schemes used for 
generating the non-uniformly distributed points later. These schemes are important to test the effectiveness of 
the horsefly algorithms. Uniform point clouds do no highlight the weaknesses of 
sequencing algorithms as David Johnson implies in his article on how to write 
experimental algorithm papers when he talks about algorithms for the TSP. 

Note that the option keys \verb|'n'| or \verb|'N'| for entering in non-uniform random-points is just 
incase the caps-lock key has been pressed on by the user accidentally. Similarly for the \verb|'u'|
and \verb|'U'| keys.

\vspace{-0.8cm} \newchunk The \verb|ims| array stores each frame of the animation. Every frame consists of 
various ``artist'' objects \footnote{This is Matplotlib terminology} (e.g. circles and segments) 
which change dynamically as the positions of the horse and flies change. 

For the animation, we need to generalize the notion of fly-legs from that of the chapter on the Classic
Horsefly problem. 

A recorded point on a fly's trajectory is marked as either of type ``genpt''(\verb|g|) or ``site''(\verb|s|). 
Then a fly-leg is either a sequence of points of type ``\verb|gg|'' or ``\verb|gsg|''.  

A horse-leg is, as before, is  a tuple of two successive points along its trajectory. 

For both the horse and flies, their trajectories consist of their corresponding legs joined end-to-end. An important
invariant for constructing the animation is that every fly's trajectory has the same number of legs as the
horse's trajectory.

\TODO{Draw a picture here illustrating the concept of a fly-leg, make light all parts of a trajectory 
that are not part of a fly's leg. You can do all this in the same picture, again constructed with asymptote}
