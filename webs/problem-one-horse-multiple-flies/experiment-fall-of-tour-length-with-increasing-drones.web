\section{\framebox{Experiment}: Decrease  in Tour Length with a Larger Number of Drones} 

\newchunk The point of using multiple drones is to get a further decrease in the tour-length of
the horse. Being a super-difficult NP-hard problem, answering this question might seem 
intractable. 

However, as a proxy we study the drop in the tour length of the horse as the number of drones
increases for the different heuristics. This might give us some kind of insight 
into the rate of decrease for the original problem. My hope is that the decrease in tour
length is linear (doubling the number of drones should decrease the tour-length by half)
Different algorithms might give different rates of decrease and it would be a good idea to 
compare them on this axis too.  Another point of interest would be if the rate of the fall
of the tour length depends somehow on the speed ratio $\varphi$. All this looks like a job 
for the design of experiments which I will study later exactly for this purpose of divising 
good computational experiments. 

\newchunk Thus far, only one algorithm has been implemented i.e. the earliest capture 
heuristic. Whatever experimental setup, I do for this experiment will be equally valid 
for other algorithms and for experiments in other chapters. 

\newchunk How should the experiment be run? Well, all experiments go into a dedicated folder. 
Each file has a dedicated main function, that coordinates the input and output required for 
the experiment. All experimental output data will be stored as YAML files, for the sake of 
later plotting. The resulting data-files will be written as run folders in the same \verb|expts|
directory. The directory will be stamped with the time of the experiments. You might want to 
keep a \verb|clean.sh| script to remove unnecessary folders and data-files. But the nature of the
script will be revealed as I do the coding, not right now.... 

\newchunk A point to note is that there will be no interative canvas involved here. Everything 
will be dictated at the terminal. Further, many of the parameters under which the experiment 
must be run will be dictated by command-line arguments. Examples of parameters relevant to this 
particular experiment are 

\begin{itemize}
\item The speed-ratio $\varphi$. 
\item The number $N$ of points chosen. 
\item The initial position of the horse and flies (what I have been terming \verb|inithorseposn| in the codes). 
\item The number $k$ of flies to be used in each run of the algorithm. 
\item Other considerations that will come up during the run of the algorithm, that I will keep documenting above this line. 
\end{itemize}

There are lots of factors and lots of responses, indeed some consideration will have to be given to 
the design of experiments for the comparison of various algorithms and giving algorithmic recommendations. 

\newchunk Here is the layout of the experiment file. It will be good to have a 
sophisticated parser to read command-line input as a python code especially for 
lists when trying to specify the number of drones used as a list as a list 
comprehension.
