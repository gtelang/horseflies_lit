\chapter{Overview of the Code Base}
NOTE: {\footnotesize The style of presentation in this chapter has been adapted from 
Chapter 2 of the Nuweb reference manual \url{http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/nuweb.pdf}}

Almost all of the code has been written in Python 2.7 and tested using the standard CPython
implementation of the language. In some cases, calls will be made to external C\texttt{++} libraries (mostly CGAL and VTK) 
using SWIG (\url{http://www.swig.org/}). This is either for speeding up a slow 
routine or to use a function that is not available in any existing Python package.

\section{Source Tree}
\input{directory-tree.tex}

There are three principal directories 
\begin{itemize}
 \item[\texttt{webs/}] This contains the source code for the entire project written in the nuweb format along with documents (mostly images)
                       needed during the compilation of the \LaTeX{} files which will be extracted from the \texttt{.web} files. 
 \item[\texttt{src/}] This contains the source code for the entire project ``tangled'' (i.e. extracted) from the \texttt{.web} files. 
 \item[\texttt{tex/}] This contains the monolithic \texttt{horseflies.tex} extracted from the \texttt{.web} files and a bunch 
of other supporing \LaTeX{} files. It also contains the final compiled \texttt{horseflies.pdf} (the current document) which contains the 
documentation of the project, interwoven with code-chunks and cross-references between them along with the experimental results.  
\end{itemize}  

The files in \texttt{src} and \texttt{tex} should not be touched. Any editing required should 
be done to the \texttt{.web} files, which should then be weaved and tangled using the
script \texttt{weave-tangle.sh} in the \texttt{webs} directory. 

\section{The Main Files} 


\newchunk Each of the files with prefix \texttt{problem-*}  contain implmentations of 
 algorithms for one specific problem. Thus \texttt{problem-watchman-horsefly.py} 
 contains algorithms for approximately solving the Watchman Horsefly problem. 

 All such files are in the directory \texttt{src/lib/}

\newchunk Similarly, each of the files with prefix \texttt{expt-*} contain code
 for testing hypotheses regarding a problem, generating counter-examples or 
 comparing the experimental performance of the algorithm implementations 
 for each of the problems. Thus \texttt{expt-watchman-horsefly.py} contains 
 code for performing experiments related to the Watchman Horsefly problem. 

 All such files are in the directory \texttt{src/expt/}

\newchunk The file \verb|main.py| in the top-level folder is the \textit{entry-point} for running code. 
Its only job is to parse the command-line arguments and pass relevant information to the handler 
functions for each problem and experiment. 

Each problem or experiment has a handler routine 
that effectively acts as a kind of ``main'' function for that module that does some house-keeping duties by 
parsing the command-line arguments passed  by main, setting up the canvas by calling the appropriate
graphics routines and calling the algorithms on the input specified through the canvas. 

@o ../main.py -cp 
@{
import sys
sys.path.append('src/lib')

import problem_classic_horsefly as chf
#import problem_segment_horsefly as shf
#import problem_one_horse_two_flies as oh2f
   
if __name__=="__main__":
     # Select algorithm or experiment 
     if (len(sys.argv)==1):
          print "Specify the problem or experiment you want to run"
          sys.exit()

     elif sys.argv[1] == "--problem-classic-horsefly":
          chf.run_handler()

     elif sys.argv[1] == "--problem-segment-horsefly":
          shf.run_handler()

     elif sys.argv[1] == "--problem-one-horse-two-flies":
          oh2f.run_handler()

     else:
          print "Option not recognized"
          sys.exit()
@| @}



\section{Support Files}
\newchunk These files contain common utility functions that will be useful for manipulating
 data-structures, common plotting and graphics routines for all horsefly-type 
 problems. All such files have the prefix \texttt{utils-*}

 All such files are in the directory \texttt{src/lib/}

\newchunk To automate testing of code during implementations, tests for various 
 routines across the entire code-base have been written in files with prefix
 \texttt{test-*}.  

 Each of the main files have a corresponding test file. Tests for functions in the 
 support files and experimental files have all been implemented in the files 
 \texttt{test-utilities.py} and \texttt{test-experiments.py} respectively.  
       
 All such files are in the directory \texttt{src/test/}
