\section{Files}

\subsection{The Main Files}
 The main files consist of $x$ main files (introduced here) and $y$ support 
 files (introduced) in the next section. The file \verb|main.py| will contain 
 the driver for the whole program. 

 Except for \verb|main.py| each of the main files contain implmentations 
 of algorithms for one specific problem. Thus \texttt{problem-classic-horsefly.py}
 contains algorithms for computing approximations of classic horsefly tours. 

\subsection{Support Files}
 These files contain common utility functions that will be useful for manipulating
 data-structures, common plotting and graphics routines for all horsefly-type 
 problems.
