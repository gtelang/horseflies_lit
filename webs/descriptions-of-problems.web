The Horsefly problem is a generalization of the well-known Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem.
In the most basic version of the Horsefly problem (which we call \textbf{``Classic Horsefly''}), we are given a set of sites, the
initial position of a truck(horse) with a drone(fly) mounted on top, and the speed of the
drone-speed $\varphi$. \footnote{ The speed of the truck is always assumed to be 1 in any of the problem 
  variations we will be considering in this report.} \footnote{ $\varphi$ is also called the ``speed ratio''.}. 

The goal is to compute a tour for both the truck and the drone to deliver package to sites
as quickly as possible. For delivery, a drone must pick up a package from the
truck, fly to the site and come back to the truck to pick up the next package for
delivery to another site. \footnote{ The drone is assumed to be able to carry at most one package at a time }
Both the truck and drone must coordinate their motions to minimize the time it takes for
all the sites to get their packages. Figure \ref{fig:prelim-example} gives an example of such a tour
computed using a greedy heuristic for $\varphi=5$.


This suite of programs implement several experimental heuristics, to solve the above NP-hard
problem and some of its variations approximately. In this short chapter, we give a description 
of the problem variations that we will be tackling. Each of the problems, has a corresponding chapter 
in Part 2, where these heuristics are described and implemented. We also give comparative analyses of 
their experimental performance on various problem instances.

\begin{description}
\item[Classic Horsefly] This problem has already described in the introduction.

\item[Segment Horsefly] In this variation, the path of the truck is restricted to that of a segment, 
  which we can consider without loss of generality to be $[0,1]$. All sites, without loss of generality 
  lie in the upper-half plane $\RR^2_{+}$. 

\item[Fixed Route Horsefly] This is the obvious generalization of Segment Horsefly, where the path
  which the truck is restricted to travel is a piece-wise linear polygonal path. 
  \footnote{More generally, the truck will be restricted to travelling on a road network, which would 
    typically be modelled as a graph embedded in the plane.} Both the initial 
  position of the truck and the drone are given. The sites to be serviced are allowed to lie anywhere in $\RR^2$. 
  Two further variations are possible in this setting, one in which the truck is allowed reversals
  and the other in which it is not. 

\item[One Horse, Two Flies] The truck is now equipped with two drones. Otherwise the setting, is exactly 
  the same as in classic horsefly. Each drone can carry only one package at a time. The drones must fly back
  and forth between the truck and the sites to deliver the packages. We allow the possibility that 
  both the drones can land at the same time and place on the truck to pick up their next package. \footnote{In reality, 
    one of the drones will have to wait for a small amount of time while the other is retrieving its package. 
    In a more realisting model, we would need to take into account this ``waiting time'' too.}

\item[Reverse Horsefly] In this model, each site (not the truck!) is equipped with a drone, which fly 
  \textit{towards} the truck to pick up their packages. We need to coordinate the motion of the truck 
  and drone so that the time it takes for the last drone to pick up its package (the ``makespan'') is 
  minimized. 

\item[Bounded Distance Horsefly] In most real-world scenarios, the drone will not be able to (or allowed to) go more than
  a certain distance $R$ from the truck. Thus with the same settings as the classic horsefly, but with the added 
  constraint of the drone and the truck never being more than a distance $R$ from the truck, how would one 
  compute the truck and drone paths to minimize the makespan of the deliveries? 

\item[Watchman Horsefly] In place of the TSP, we generalize the Watchman route problem here. 
  \footnote{ although abstractly, the Watchman route problem can be viewed as a kind of TSP}
  We are given as input a simple polygon and the initial position of a truck and a drone. The drone has 
  a camera mounted on top which is assumed to have $360^{\circ}$ vision. Both the truck and drone can move, 
  but the drone can move at most euclidean distance \footnote{The version where instead geodesic distance is 
    considered is also interesting} $R$ from the truck. 

  We want every point in the polygon to be seen by the drone at least once. The goal is to minimize the time it 
  takes for the drone to be able to see every point in the simple polygon. In other words, we want to minimize
  the time it takes for the drone (moving in coordinattion with the truck) to patrol the entire polygon.
