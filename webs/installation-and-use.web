\chapter{Installation and Use}

To run these programs: 

\begin{alphalist}
\item \crunchy{Get Docker} Docker is an open-source containerization program that is easily installable on 
  Windows\footnote{You might need to turn on virtualization explicitly in your BIOS, after installing Docker 
  as I needed to while setting Docker up on Windows. Here is a snapshot of an image when turning on Intel's 
  virtualization technology through the BIOS:

  GNU/Linux distribution. For a quick introduction to Docker containerization, watch the first two minutes of

  \end{description}

\item \crunchy{Download customized Ubuntu image} Download a customized Ubuntu Docker image that 
  I've created with \verb| docker pull gtelang/Ubuntu_customized|. The customized Ubuntu image is approximately
  7 GB which contains all the libraries (e.g. CGAL, VTK, numpy, and matplotlib) that I typically use to run 
  my research codes portably. \footnote{ On my home internet connection downloading this Ubuntu-image typically takes about 5 minutes.}
\item \crunchy{Clone repository} \verb|git clone gtelang/horseflies.git|
\item \crunchy{Build the downloaded Ubuntu image} Open up your favorite terminal emulator, like say xterm on GNU/Linux, 
  iTerm on macOS or Powershell on Windows 10 and type \\ 
  \verb|cd horseflies ; docker build .| \footnote{ Note the period at the end! This has to be typed in too!}
\item \crunchy{Run all experiments again} If you want to run all the experiments as described in the paper again to reproduce
  the reported results on your machine \footnote{ Allowing, of course,  for differences between 
  your machine's CPU and mine when it comes to reporting absolute running time}, 
  type in \verb|docker run|
\item \crunchy{Run algorithms interactively}  Else if you want to test the algorithms in interactive mode 
  (where you get to select the problem-type, mouse-in the sites on a canvas, set the initial position of 
  the truck and drone and set $\varphi$) you will need  to set up an X-connection between the Docker container 
  and your host OS.
 
\begin{itemize}
\item On the Ubuntu 16.04 partition of my Thinkpad laptop, I had to follow the instructions 
      given in this short video: \url{https://youtu.be/RDg6TRwiPtg}
\item On the Windows 10 partition of the same laptop, I had to follow the instructions in 
      \url{https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-Docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde}
\end{itemize}

If you want to delete the Ubuntu image, (it is 7GB afterall!) please watch this short video

The nice thing about Docker is that it makes it easy to run softwares on different OS'es portably and neatly side-steps the 
dependency hell problem (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell}.)

The headache of installing different library dependencies correctly on different machines running different OS'es, 
is replaced \textbf{only} by having to learn how to install Docker on your particular machine, and to know how 
set up an X-connection between the host OS and an instantiated container.
