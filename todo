1. Have a plot function for each of the algorithms individually. 
2. For Joe's thought experiment, you should have two plots
  a.  one indicating the thought experment tour
  b.  the tour where everyone moves in parallel
  Put them in separate ax frames but in the same plot

Use reverse horsefly collection center, the end point of the 
greedy concentric routing heuristic!!! And then do Kintic TSP 
on that. 

use only the penultimate leg? or just the current positions
of the flies, to be able to scale to larger simulations.
Right now because i am plotting trajectories at every step
it takes quadratic time to generate the animation.
