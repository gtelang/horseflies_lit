- [ ] What is the format of the horsefly tour?   ::
      See algo_exact_given_specific_ordering for 
      an answer. 

- [ ] Construct a dummy tour 

- [ ] Write it to a YAML file. 

- [ ] compute_collinear_horseflies_tour_length

- [ ] PolicyNaive...this one just keeps inserting 
  into the appropriate position does not 
  do any fancy neighborhood searching tricks

- [ ] Later we will have variations on PolicyNaive
  and try to improve the algorithms. This will 
  be my gold-standard implementation. 
  The gold-standard implementation will be 
  sufficient for the report for now. 
  
  Make sure all the plots are in place for this 
  so you know what variations to make. 

- [ ] Implement the MST lower-bound principle. 

- [ ] For collinear horseflies you need to know
  the ratio of deformation, introduced. This 
  will also be necessary for figures in the paper. 
  Implement this. 

- [ ] The Next policy will be doubling this tree
  to retrieve the ordering. 

- [ ] Insert a clock statemnt. You will write the 
  time it took to execute the while loop. 

- [ ] Asymptote code, to generate the collinear-horseflies
  thingy. Make a subroutine for this. 
========================================================

To render the markdown state to file, we will need to rip 
out the internals of the plothorsefly routine and stick 
it into the chunk here. The visualization for this, will 
be different from the ordinary representation on the canvas. 

For each state written out make a plot, and save it as a 500 dpi 
png file. Also mark the current algo_state_counter somewhere in 
the title. 

All the states to be rendered are insertion_policy.xyz
