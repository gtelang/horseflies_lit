Implement exact order for Reverse Horsefly
Implement exact order for Single Drone Classic Horsefly
Implement exact order for Single Truck Multiple Drones

Experiments
-----------

- Compare deformation factor for the collinear horsefly idea
  the goal is to decide a bunch of heuristics that will give the 
  least deformation factor. because this is useful for m-guillotine
  and greedy heuristics in deciding the performance.

- Compare the performance of getting makespans for heurisitcs
  for various algorithms. 	
  - Greedy nearest neighbor
  - Greedy insertion
  - TSP concorde get heuristic. 
  - Max Dispersion Heuristic part about 
    extracting an order has to be implemented. 	
  - The Recursive Fermat Weber Splitting Heuristic

  Get this for clustered and non-clustered data. 

- How does the length of the tour decrease with increasing speed 
  ratio? 	

- For package handoff measure the deformation factor
  before and after optimization. This is useful for 
  explaining the usefulness of straight line package
  handoff. 	


- Explain the notion of arrangement TSP to solve the segment 
  center problem. 	


Video-clips
-----------
- Single Truck Multiple Drones: earliest capture heuristic
- More graph theory obstacles for horse and flies, just produce
  pictures, maybe with a small explanation about 	

    The recursive Fermat Weber heuristic uses possible? 
    This applies to multiple drones too. If you can show
    that the max-dispersion heuristic and recursive fermat
    weber heuristic are better than greedy, then you will have 
    a novel method right there. (For phi=1, does this give a tree
    with weight lower than the MST? My suspician is that it is polytime, 
    because if $\varphi>0$ and the half-plane propery can you run 
    experiments on this, the nice thing about the heuristic is that 
    it will generalize to multiple flies too. Can this be applied to reverse
    horsefly also? 








-------------------------
- Greedy incremental, post optimizer LP/SLSQP.
     I am not aplying this inside the body of the function.
     Igt should be applied just after the *.........while loop......*
- Collinear horseflies tour length / That obtained after post optimizer
- Greedy incremental with post=optimizer/TSP with post-optimizer
- Greedy incremental vs/ wweight of phi mst, is it good?
  An example where the algorithm greedy gives better example than phi-=mst
- How much greedy incremental improve upon greedy, both with post-optimizer?

All these, do not add to interactive right now except for first.

What I need to do right now. 
===========================

- Make sure algorithms are not generating stupid folder output. 
- Makespans of algorithms TSP, Greedy, Greedy Insertion. 
- Makespans of the reverse horsefly algorithms. 
- Package Handoff Makespan deformation, why the straight-line package handoff matters. 
- Give a diagram demonstrating Package Handoff. 
- Send the video demonstrating how the order of delivery changes as 
  the speed ratio increases. 
- Segment Horsefly : important observation for phi <= 1. You can 
  solve this exactly

Todo
====

1. Have a plot function for each of the algorithms individually. 
2. For Joe's thought experiment, you should have two plots
  a.  one indicating the thought experment tour
  b.  the tour where everyone moves in parallel
  Put them in separate ax frames but in the same plot

Use reverse horsefly collection center, the end point of the 
greedy concentric routing heuristic!!! And then do Kintic TSP 
on that. 

use only the penultimate leg? or just the current positions
of the flies, to be able to scale to larger simulations.
Right now because i am plotting trajectories at every step
it takes quadratic time to generate the animation.
