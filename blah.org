It's best just to ignore Gaurish. I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig: You get dirty, and besides, 
the pig likes it. Instead, we should investigate the real story behind Gaurish's convictions. We must search
 for the truth, find the facts, and convey the message that Gaurish and his functionaries have harassed, 
abused, and smeared me, not because I lied about Gaurish's volage-brained campaigns but because I 
told the truth. In particular, I said that I'm not stupid. I'm not a sheep. I don't blindly believe Gaurish's 
repeated claim that it is his moral imperative to besmirch the memory of some genuine historic figures. Instead
, I, hardheaded cynic that I am, insist that it's very telling that, with zero self-awareness, he said that his 
hecklers deserve to be subjected to extreme hardship for being crafty hypochondriacs. Clearly, Gaurish 
doesn't realize that his trained seals are the most crafty hypochondriacs there are. He also doesn't realize 
that telling the truth is too much trouble for obscene leguleians bent on getting their way. I do not say 
this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with anything. Rather, I say 
it as someone who firmly believes that Gaurish is a niddering liar. Let's list some of Gaurish's more 
beer-guzzling lies: First, he thinks that Man's eternal search for Truth is a challenge to be avoided 
at all costs. Second, he maintains that his opinions are good for the environment, human rights, 
and baby seals. And third, he wants us to believe that we can change the truth if we don't like it the 
way it is. I presented that list to get you to see that if I were elected Ruler of the World, my first act 
of business would be to oppose Gaurish and all he stands for. I would further use my position to inform 
certain segments of the Earth's population that if Gaurish can give us all a succinct and infallible 
argument proving that he was chosen by God as the trustee of His wishes and desires, I will personally
 deliver his Nobel Prize for Sick Rhetoric. In the meantime, I need your help if I'm ever to give the needy 
a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. “But I'm only one person,” you might protest. 
“What difference can I make?” The answer is: a lot more than you think. You see, Gaurish uses 
scientific-sounding terminology—"phonons", “melanocyte”, “extrapyramidal tract”, and 
so on—to create the impression that.
