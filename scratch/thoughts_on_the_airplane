There are several greedy strategies we can try, and since all are 
reasonable give a detailed classificaiton of which scheme does better
when, and rather than give an approximation algorithm for OPT, 

just say withing how much distance two greedy strategies come within
each other. 

Note that my greedy strategy is better than the convex optimization
of John in the sense, that if points are greedily revealed only along
the way and nothing is revealed at once, you still have a way 
to do somethiung without doing the global steps of solving TSP before
and then the post-run convex optimization. 

Another thing is to give bounds on how increasing the number of drones 
in your strategy decreases the tour length. Again you don't need to do 
this for OPT which might actually be very very difficuly. 

You only need to do this for each of the greedy strategies. We will need 
some sort of bounds involving only say the drones and the well-separated pair
decomposition. 

Also you might want to ask, by how much performing the convex optimization
improve the length of the tour. 

starbursts will be critical in the analysis of multiple drone heuristics. 
can you reorganize the nearest neighbor computations and speed them up
given the peculia nature of your operations, repeated as they are?
