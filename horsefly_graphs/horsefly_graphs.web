\chapter{Introduction}

This set of literate programs implement heuristics to solve Horsefly type problems on graphs. The generic problem for this setting 
is: given a set of nodes, with some distinguished nodes marked as delivery points and one node marked as the starting point 
of a truck and drone we want to minimize the makespan of the delivery process in which the drone departs from the truck 
with a package, flies to a site along a sequence of edges, drops of the package and returns to the truck (which itself might be moving 
along the graph edges) to pick up the next package for delivery. For the sake of simplicity, we only allow the drone itself to do the delivery 
and the meeting points between the truck and drone to happen at the nodes of the graph. Some edges in the graph will be traversable by 
only the truck or only the drone and some edges will be traversable by both. 

The challenge in this problem is to set up a coordinated schedule of the truck and the drone so that the total delivery time is minimized. 
The truck is assumed to always travel with unit speed and the drone with integer speed $\varphi \in \{2,3,\ldots\}$. 

While almost all the algorithms developed here are intended to be graph agnostic, the input graphs for such problems will typically come 
about from the discretization of geometric domains where there might be obstacles, some for the drone, some for the truck, some for maybe both. 
To test the algorithms interactively, I will typically use rectangular obstacles, along with an appropriate background mesh of points.



Several variants on this basic theme are possible in which a truck might have been equipped with more than one drone or there might be 
constraints at the sites or pick-up points (such as service or package-handoff times). Lots of special cases abound too: what if the underlying 
graph is or outerplanar planar, what if the set of truck and/or drone edges form a tree? What if the truck is restricted to travelling only 
along a path-graph? 

Heuristics for such variants and their experimental-performance analyses 
will also be discussed later. Such problems are typically extremely hard, so all heuristics are meant to be approximations to the optimal 
routing scheme for each instance. Algorithms developed will typically use a combination of greedy strategies, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound
and local search. Several interesting problems also arise in being able to efficiently implement a particular strategy and so answers to these questions
will often be developed in tandem with the implementation of different strategies for Horsefly problems. 


\chapter{User Input}

This chapter implements (boring  but important) UI code for the user to mouse in rectangular obstacles, service points, and initial position of the truck and drone onto 
the Matplotlib canvas and generate an appropriate geometric graph for the truck and drone to travel along. Typically these geometric graphs 
will be the visibility graph, delaunay triangulation or some other graph on such points which can be set at run-time through a command-line menu. 
The resulting algorithms, however, will typically be graph-agnostic unless explicitly indicated in the doc-string of the implemented algorithm. 

One can also enter in the set of truck and drone obstacles along with any discretization parameters via a YAML file. This is particularly useful 
for storing nice instances and answers discovered wihle experimenting on a canvas. 

Here is a high-level overview of the \verb|horsefly_graphs.py| module.

\section{Local Data Structures}

The data-structure used by the canvas for manipulating the input is \verb|HorseflyInputGraph|. It performs simple house-keeping duties such as keeping track of the 
sites, the initial position of the truck, various obstacles etc. The main method for this class is \verb|getTour| which generates the actual graph according to 
the graph-policy specified and runs the appropriate algorithm on the generated graph. The flag \verb|obstacle\_input\_mode\_p| is toggled to \verb|True| or 
\verb|False| according as obstacles are being entered onto the canvas. The input is entered in two modes (the default site insertion mode and the optional 
obstacle insertion mode, which is toggled by pressing the ``o'' or ``O'' key. )

The definition of the method \verb|makeHorseflyInputGraph| will be given later. This will help exposition since details of the function depend on the 
\verb|Obstacle| class which will be introduced in the next code-chunk.

The UI code allows only rectangular obstacles to be inserted for convenience of implementation. As has already been mentioned, once the underlying domain of obsctales and surrounding
space is discretized the algorithms are graph agnostic. Code for inserting obstacles of more complicated shapes will be added later.

\section{Some basic canvas functions}

A few basic functions are needed to manipulate the matplotlib canvas, such as clearing the canvas of patches, setting aspect ratio etc. We implement them here.

      ax.set_xlim([utils_graphics.xlim[0], utils_graphics.xlim[1]])

      ax.set_aspect(1.0)

def clearPatches(ax):
    # Get indices cooresponding to the polygon patches
    for index , patch in zip(range(len(ax.patches)), ax.patches):
        if isinstance(patch, mpl.patches.Polygon) == True:
            patch.remove()
    ax.lines[:]=[]
    applyAxCorrection(ax)

def clearAxPolygonPatches(ax):

    # Get indices cooresponding to the polygon patches
    for index , patch in zip(range(len(ax.patches)), ax.patches):
        if isinstance(patch, mpl.patches.Polygon) == True:
            patch.remove()
    ax.lines[:]=[]

The \verb|main| function just sets up the basic canvas and the container to hold the user-input data. Once the canvas is started, it ``listens in'' on the mouse-press and key-press events 
to enter various elements such as the initial position of the truck and drone, the sites of delivery, the input obstacles.

This function handles the manages events corresponding to key-presses on the computer key-board. For instance, 
pressing \verb|Ctrl+| $\rightarrow$ increases (resp. decreases) the X-dimension of the rectangle. Similarly for 
the Y-dimension and the keys \verb|Ctrl+| $\uparrow$ and \verb|Ctrl+| $\downarrow$. Behavior of other-keys is 
self-explantory as documented in the code-chunks below.

This function just implements the behavior of the canvas under mouse-clicks. The left mouse button double-clicked inserts a site onto 
the canvas while the right mouse button inserts the intial position of the truck and drone. These two types of points have been given 
different colors. Later on the points used in the background grid to discretize the domain will again be shown in a different colour.

This function allows allows me to move a potential obstacle over the canvas before double-clicking it into place. It is called a hovering obstacle because
the position of the rectangular obstacle follows the position of the mouse cursor as it moves over the matplotlib canvas. There are three obstacle modes
one for truck-only obstacles (indicated by crimson) one for drone-only obstacles (indicated by blue) and one for obstacles common to both the truck and 
drone (indicated by green). To exit any of these obstacle placement modes to insert more sites, just press the corresponding obstacle mode keys again ('h', 'f' and 'g')
to toggle them.

\section{Discretization of the Geometric Domain}

Having placed all the obstacles in memory, we now discretize the underlying geometric domain. I will be 
using CGAL for performing Segment-Segment intersection tests while building visibiity graphs on any 
underlying grid. For the moment, during an initial implementation, I will assume that none of the sites are 
covered by any of the obstacles and no two obstacles intersect. The background grid points however, 
may lie inside the obstacles.

      There can be several types of policies for each of the horse and fly-graphs. 
      The most basic one and the default, used is just the visibility graph on the set 
      of points. A segment is in the visibility graph if it does not intersect any
